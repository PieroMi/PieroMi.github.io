        "For me, painting in general, is to have man as a central point in all manifestations and, 
        as a figurative painter, I try to represent my time, the current man, the world that surrounds 
        me with its truths, sometimes pleasant and sometimes unpleasant, with its warm or cold environment 
        but always with the beauty I feel when contemplating it — For me everything in life has plastic beauty"

        Miranda's childhood memories were of harvesting honey from his family's many hives, which they owned along the route from Empalme to Guayaquil. 
        He always drew as a child, scribbled on any paper he found, and copied art from the books his mother had in the house.

        In June of 1956, with Theo Constante and under the guidance of the professor named André Gardos, he made the sets of the theater 9 de Octubre for the 
        ballet of the Flowers. At that time they exhibited their works in the Art Gallery that Grace de Avilés maintained on the seventh floor of the 
        building of La Casa de la Cultura, he was classmates with Estuardo Maldonado and Ángel Bravo and they planned a trip to study abroad in Europe

        After raising enough money through the selling of a few paintings and with money that he had saved up he was able to travel to Italy in the Italian navy ship named 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_training_ship_Amerigo_Vespucci" class="link">Amerigo Vespucci</a>. Once in Rome, he was greeted and welcomed in the
        home of a Vatican Broadcaster by the name of Manuel Becerra born in Esmeralda, Ecuador. After a month he finally settled in a home near the sports complex named Foro Italico.
        With the financial help of the scholarship by UNESCO, The Academy of Arts in Rome, and his beloved Father he was able to sustain a lifestyle that allowed him to focus on his studies.

        In 1959 he won an award during an exhibition that was held the streets of <a href="https://www.romeing.it/via-margutta/" class="link" target="_blank">Via Margutta</a>. It was held for amateur artists, and later
        on that year he won another award named 'Fiat Award'. "Painting landscapes and nudes with models, always trying to learn different techniques rather than divulging myself as artist" said Luis Miranda

        . After winning a few more awards he was granted a monthly scholarship directly from the Italian government of 80,000 Italian Liras.
        With the financial stability he was able to move to Cinecitta in Rome, where he studied and worked making art for the scenography of numerous films.
        In 1961 he graduated from The School of Arts in Rome and moved back to Guayaquil due to some family matters, and that is when he met his later to be wife, Gloria Guerrero Muga.

    <p class="paragraph">
       In 1961, just after returning from Europe he decided to move to New York in pursue of a different life and in hopes to continue a career as an artist.
       He worked for a text tile factory as a mechanic that was owned by many Italians with whom he was able to communicate and get along very well with.
       During his bohemian days living in New York he'd spend time within the combines of jazz bars and watched the artists and people dancing while he'd draw them. <a href="http://127.0.0.1:5501/images/bandpaint.jpg" class="link"  target="_blank">As shown here</a>.
       In 1963 he married Gloria and they birthed their two older sons, Piero & Luis in New Jersey.

        He returned home in the 1970s and had their third child, Mario. He decided to purse a career teaching arts & crafts and eventually teaching at the <a href="https://www.ucsg.edu.ec/" class="link" target="_blank">Universidad Catolica de Santiago de Guayaquil</a>. 
        He continued to paint and draw everyday and won multiple awards throughout his career. In the later years he lived between his home in Guayaquil and his beach home located in Chanduy where he enjoyed the solitude and quietness to paint as much as he wanted with no distractions or noise.
